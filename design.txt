Design of ggplot2 for Go
========================

Data Input
----------

Data input is either Slice-Of-Measurements (SOM) of the form

    type Measurement struct {
        Age    int
        Weight float64
        Height float64
        Born   time.Time
	Gender string
    }
    func (m Measurement) BMI() float64 {
        return m.Weight/(m.Height*m.Height)
    }

    var data []Measurement

or of the Collection-Of-Slices (COS) form
    
    type Measurement struct {
        Age    []int
        Weight []float64
        Height []float64
        Born   []time.Time
        Gender []string
    }
    func (m Measurement) BMI(i int) float64 {
        return m.Weight[i]/(m.Height[i]*m.Height[i])
    }

    var data Measurement

Both forms are converted to a Data Frame which is basically a generic
representation in the COS form. It resembles a R data frame.


Plot Creation
-------------

Plot Creation is the following process:
  
  1.  Split data according to facetting specification.
      Happens only on facetted plots, each facett is basically
      treated as its own plot and represented as a panel.
      Result: A n x m data frames in Domain Units, original field names

  2a. Some or all fields are mapped to aesthetics.
      Mapped fields are renamed to the aesthetic.
      Unmapped fields are removed from the data frame.
      Scales are added for the "known" aesthetics if not
      jet present.
      The mapped fields are transformed according to the
      scale transformation (identitiy, log, sqrt, 1/x, ...)
      
      Result: Data frame in Domain Units, unmapped fields have
      been removed, other have the mapped aes name and are
      scale transformed

  2b. Pre-Train Scales. Usefull if upcumming stat wants to knows what
      the full x-range will be.

  3.  A statistical transform is applied, typically some kind of
      summary statistics like binning, boxplot or smoothing.
      Result: A completely new data frame with new field names.
      (Or the original input if no stat is requested.)

  4a. Some (typically new) fields might be mapped to (new) aestetics.
      Scale transformations are performed during this mapping.

  4b. Rename fields to match expected input from Geom in next step.
      Result: A data frame with field names suitable to be rendered
      as a specific Geom.

  5a. Apply geom specific position adjustments.

  5b. Train scales.

  5c. Reparametrise Geoms to a set of fundamental geoms.
      Result: One or several fundamantal geoms with their data frames
      in Domain Units with field names suitable for primitive geoms.

  6.  Prepare scales. Use learned domain in 5b to set up the needed
      domain-to-aesthetics functions.

  7.  Uses these scales to render the fundamental geoms produced in
      step 5c into Grobs (Graphical Objects).
      Result: Structure of Grobs, coordinates/values in Range Units.

  8a. Apply Coordinate Transformations: Interprete <x,y> pairs in
      a Grob eg. as <y,x> (flip coordinates), as <r,ϑ> (polar coordiantes)
      or <x,-y> (reversed y) and so on.
      Munching (interpolate lines by lots of small segments.) for
      non-cartesian coordinates.

  8b. Render into Viewport.

  9.  Render Guides (Axes and Legends), render rest (title, facett boxes).


Statistical Transforms
----------------------
Basic idea is dead simple. Take one data frame and construct an other data
frame which summarizes/describes the original one.

Only complication: What to do if the input data frame contains more
slots/fields than the stat can operate on?  Example: StatBin needs
"x" and can use optional "weight". What to do if extra field "Gender"
is present in input data frame?
The following may happen:
  -  Completely ignore the additional fields, pretend they are just
     not there.
  -  Fail. Do not process such data.
  -  Group (facett) input data on the additional field(s) if the
     additional fields are discrete.
Ignore and fail are simple; grouping n the StatBin with extra Gender example:
Split input data frame into two frames Gender=='f' and Gender=='m'
apply Simple StatBin to both and combine both results afterwards to something
like
       x  count density Gender
       5     0    0.0     m
      10     6    0.2     m 
      15    11    0.4     m
      20     9    0.3     m
       5     2    0.1     f
      10     5    0.2     f
      15    15    0.5     f
      20     0    0.0     f

The fields x and Gender where present in the input to StatBin, the fields
count and density (also ncount and ndensity) are new fields.
Gender is passed through pretty much unchanged while x is aggregated,
here the center of the bins, i.e. none of the resulting x might occur
in the input data frame.

Statistical transforms cannot be chained. (Well not automatically:
If data frame generation and applying a stat is exported the user could
chain several stats manually.)


Aesthetics Mapping
------------------

Mapping of Aesthetics may happen before and after statistical transform.
Example StatBin: x must be mapped before (as StatBin needs x as input)
while mapping the generated count to y can happen only after computing
the stat.

What happens if one of the known real aesthetics is mapped:
  -  The field in the data frame is renamed to the aesthetics
     (e.g. BMI is replaced by y)
  -  A scale is added for this aesthetics if not present in the plot.
     Depending on the type of the data frame field this might be continous
     or discrete.
  -  The scale is pre-trained: TODO: really here? not own phase?


Complications, differences from ggplot2 for R
---------------------------------------------
All of the following do _not_ produce points for the calculated bins:
  ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=x)) + stat_bin() + geom_point()
  ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=x)) + stat_bin(aes(y=..count..)) + geom_point()
  ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=x)) + stat_bin(aes(y=..count..)) + geom_point(count=count)
  ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=x)) + stat_bin(aes(y=..count..)) + geom_point(y=..count..)
  ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=x)) + stat_bin(aes(y=..count..)) + geom_point(y=count)
  ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=x)) + stat_bin(aes(y=..count..)) + geom_point(y=count)
  ... and so on.
The ggplot2 way of doing this is by use of
  ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=x)) + stat_bin(aes(y=..count..), geom="point")
which is pretty straight forward for an interactive tool but does not
fit well into a prepared plot with fixed layers, stats and geoms.

It seem impossible in ggplot for R to plot geom_crossbar to a calculated
stat_boxplot as the calculated middle cannot be wired to the required
y value. The standard way in ggplot2 for R is to add either a stat or
a geom but not both (maybe change the geom in the stat).  This won't
work properly here.

[[ 
   Maybe stuff like plot.AddHistogram or plot.AddBoxplot which
   adds suitable stat and geom in one step might be nice
   convenience functions, maybe in a subpackage, once...
]]


Position Adjustments
--------------------
All four adjustments (dodge, jitter, stack and fill) work some geoms
only in ggplot2 for R. Boxplots can use identity and dodge. Stacking (and
filling) works properly only for geom_bar.  The ggplot for R code is a bit
shaky here: It works hardwired on ymin and ymax so that stacking crossbars
looses the the crossbar at the y value as this one is not moved...
It kinda works for ggplot2 for R as the normal way is to add either a
stat _or_ a geom, but not both.

Conclusion: Original ggplot2 for R solution is not practical here.
Solution: Make position adjustment a property of the individial
geoms. Some geoms might not allow and position adjustments at all
or just a subset.


Geoms
-----
There are aa handfull of fundamental geoms, these correspond directly
to grobs.  Other geoms might be simple reparametrizations of a fundamental
grob: E.g. GeomTile, described by <x,y,width,height,fill,...> is just
a different parametrization of a GeomRect of <xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax,fill...>.
Other geoms can be represented by a set of other geoms, e.g. GeomBoxplot
consists of GeomRects, GeomLines and GeomPoints. 

Constructing geoms performs the following parts:
  - Adjust positions (dodge, stack, ...).
  - Compute "bounding boxes", e.g. a bar at x=1 might reach from.
    0.25 to 1.75.
  - Train scales with these bounding boxes.
  - Emit fundamental geoms.


Grobs, Graphical Objects
------------------------

Grobs are the primitive building blocks for graphics
  -  Points.   <x,y, style, size, color, alpha>
  -  Text.     <x,y, text, color, size, v-/h-align, font, alpha>
  -  Lines.    <x0,y0,x1,y1,...,xn,yn, style, color, size/width>
  -  Polygon   <x0,y0,x1,y1,...,xn,yn, fill, alpha>
  -  Rectangle <xmin,ymin, xmax,ymax, style, color, width, fill, alpha>
  -  Container <xmin,ymin, xmax,ymax>
All grob coordinates are in the interval [0,1]. Container group grobs
and provide a convenient way to reparam different grobs of e.g. one geom.

TODO: Rectangle Needed? Achievable through Grob-Reparametrisation of
Polygon but may be convenient...



Boxplot
-------

Maybe the most complex stuff. If this works everythings should be fine.

Prerequisite:
  - One discrete field is mapped to x.
  - One field is mapped to y.
  - Other fields may be mapped to color, fill, linetype

Statistical transform:
  - Partition input data by color, fill and linetype. 
  - For each partition:
      * Group on the discrete x values
      * For each group compute min, low, med, high, max
        (and the outliers) based on the set of ys.
      * Return DF with (x, min,q1,median,q3,max)
  - Combine partitions to single DF which might look like
    (x, min,q1,median,q3,max, color, linetype)

Geom construction:
  - Wire generated stat fields to geom input fields, e.g.
    rename q1-->low, median-->mid, q3-->high
  - For same-x entries in the DF: Apply position adjustments.
    The only sane here is dodging, but nevertheless, why not
    stack them....
  - While building the geom: Train the scales, especially
    the y scale.
  - Produce a set of "Basic-Geoms" which biject to grobs and
    do not need a reparametrisation: Produce rectangle,
    vertical lines, horizontal median and outlier dots.
  - Outlier dots could be read from the original DF?
    

Grob construction:
  - All scales should be trained now, prepare projection
    functions.
  - Use projection functions to turn values in the different
    geoms to real grobs in viewport coordinates.
